  Schema for a push item dict, as accepted by methods in the pushcollector
  library.

$schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#

type: object

properties:
  # A filename for this push item.
  #
  # Only a filename (basename) should be provided, with no leading path.
  #
  # A non-empty filename must always be provided, even for push items which do
  # not represent a file. In such cases, an identifier for the push item which
  # is meaningful to end-users should be provided.
  #
  # For example, container image manifests may provide their digest as the filename,
  # despite that manifests are not guaranteed to be stored as files.
  filename:
    type: string
    pattern: "^[^/]+$"

  # The state of this push item.
  state:
    type: string
    enum:
    # Successful states:
    - PUSHED        # successfully pushed
    - PENDING       # not yet processed
    - EXISTS        # push item already existed at destination
    - DELETED       # successfully deleted
    - MISSING       # delete was requested but item is already absent
    - SKIPPED       # processing of file was skipped

    # Unsuccessful states:
    - UNKNOWN       # an unknown error occurred when handling this item
    - ONSERVER      # item already exists at destination but with incorrect content
    - NOTFOUND      # content for this push item is missing (e.g. file not on local disk)
    - UPLOADFAILED  # uploading this content to remote server failed
    - INVALIDFILE   # something is wrong with the content of this file
    - UNSIGNED      # push item is unsigned, where policy requires signature
    - CHECKSUM      # push item actual checksum did not match expected
    - SUBSCRIPTION  # push item could not be added to repositories on remote server
    - NOTPUSHED     # did not attempt to push due to earlier errors

    # Legacy states, please don't use these in new code
    - PUBLISHED
    - EXPORTED
    - DOCKERTAGMISMATCH

  # The source of this push item.
  #
  # If the push item is a file, this should be the full path to the file, as
  # accessed by the tool processing the push items.  If the push item does not
  # represent a file, this should generally be omitted.
  src:
    anyOf:
    - type: "null"
    - type: string

  # Destination of this push item.
  #
  # This library doesn't define any semantics for the meaning of "dest";
  # any strings may be provided here.
  #
  # Examples for possible uses of "dest" include:
  # - a path to a directory (for items pushed using rsync)
  # - a Pulp repository name (for items pushed using Pulp)
  dest:
    anyOf:
    - type: "null"
    - type: string

  # Checksums for this push item, e.g. if this item represents a file, then the
  # md5sum and sha256sum of that file's bytes

    - type: object
      properties:

      additionalProperties: false

  # A string representing the origin of this push item.
  #
  # This library doesn't enforce any particular semantics for the "origin"
  # field, but it is generally expected to record some info on how this push
  # item was discovered. For example:
  #
  # - if this item was pushed due to belonging to advisory ABC-123, the origin
  #   field may be set to "ABC-123"
  # - if this item was pushed due to recursing under /some/path, the origin field
  #   may be set to "/some/path"
  # - if this item was pushed due to an explicit request from an end-user, the
  #   origin may be set to "metadata"
  #
  origin:
    anyOf:
    - type: "null"
    - type: string

  # NVR for the koji build from which this push item was extracted, if any
  build:
    anyOf:
    - type: "null"
    - type: string

  # If this push item was GPG signed, this should be an identifier for the
  # signing key used.
  #
  # Generically a short key ID such as "F21541EB" is used, though the library
  # doesn't enforce this.
